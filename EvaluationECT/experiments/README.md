# Evaluation

    This part contains pre-training and evaluation the total algorithm.
## Pre-training
 implement pre-training, create the model
 accuracy_score, normalized_mutual_info_score, adjusted_rand_score
 evaluate the performance of datasets with feedforward autoencoder
    * the performance
 dengrom purity measurement
 adjust the code with layer wise autoencoder, to verification
